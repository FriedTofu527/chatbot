Dear CACC Chinese School Parents，
Volunteer Parent Judges Needed for the Chinese Academic Competition
The annual Chinese Academic Competition will be held on March 30th during Chinese classes. Each Chinese classroom (except for some high school classes) requires three parents to serve as volunteer judges during the competition. We currently have several classes that need more parent volunteers. The only requirements are that you speak fluent Mandarin and be available on March 30th for one or two time slots: 9:00-9:50 and/or 11:00-11:50.
If you are interested and have not yet signed up for a position, please send an email to cs@caccusa.org and provide the following information: your name, email, phone number, your child's current class and teacher name, and the time slots you are available for. Thank you for your support!
