Chinese Programs Information Session: For many years, CACC Chinese School has been providing high school credit classes, Jinan University Chinese, Ma Liping Chinese, and Chinese as a Second Language programs. These courses cover all kinds of Chinese learning needs for all ages from kindergarten to the 12th grade AP exam. We have been working hard to create a continuous learning ladder and a friendly learning environment for students. To support your child’s Chinese learning, we will hold an information session on Chinese courses this Sunday. It will focus on explaining the High School Chinese Credit classes, especially the placement tests, class registration, credit transfer, textbooks, etc.. All CACC parents are welcome to attend. You are more than welcome to invite students and parents in the community who plan on taking high school credit courses or are interested in learning Chinese to participate.
