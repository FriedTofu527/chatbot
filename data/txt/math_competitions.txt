只有全日制的学校可以申请成为考试中心，所以CACC本身不会组织AMC8 考试。我们是借助Thomas Hart Middle School 的考场参加考试。考试报名一般会在9月份，考试资源有限，只对在中文学校修课的家庭开放，服务于自己学校确实没有组织AMC8 考试或者是小学生。报名方式会在Weekly Newsletter 中发布。协助报名是中文学校做的义工性质的工作，所有的报名费都交给Thomas Hart.需要特别说明的是，三谷地区大多数的中学都组织AMC 8考试，但他们的报名常常晚于Thomas Hart。有的甚至晚到11月、12月。请各位家长去咨询一下学校的数学老师、校长、及前辈家长，请在自己学校参加这个考试。之前经常出现的状况是家长们一看到CACC中文学校这里可以报名了，而自己孩子所在学校还没有音讯，就先在中文学校报名占个位置，等到自己学校报名通知出来了，又在自己学校报名。请注意 ⚠️ ：一个学生只能在一个考场考一次试，不能两个地方报名考两次。
AMC 10(9th-10th grade): CACC Chinese School doesn't offer AMC 10 and AMC 12 tests.
AMC 10 (10th grade & below): 25 Questions/75 minutes
AMC 10 A & AMC 10 B @ November  
Both the A and the B versions of AMC 10 and AMC 12 have the same number of questions and rules of scoring, equal in difficulty and distribution of topics.  The only differences are the competition dates, and that each version has a different set of questions.
A correct answer is worth 6 points, an unanswered question is worth 1.5 points, and a wrong answer is worth 0 points. The maximum score on the AMC 10 is 150 points. A common realistic initial target is 90 points on the AMC 10. Your final target will likely be 100-105 points on the AMC 10, the historical cutoffs for qualifying for the AIME.
