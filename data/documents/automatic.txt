The newsletters from CACC Chinese School 【CACC公益讲座】美国国会青年奖说明会 ，助力青少年成长的高含金量荣誉申请指南 [CACC Public Lecture] Congressional Award Workshop A High-Value Honor for Youth Development: Your Guide to Applying Aug 18, 2025 (Scroll down for English) 以往CACC为符合条件的志愿者们申请美国总统义工奖。但是美国总统义工奖已于2025年5月停摆，恢复时间不详。为保持同学们做义工的热情，给同学们为CACC和社区做奉献的精神予以肯定，从今年起CACC会全力支持志愿者们申请美国国会青年奖。 美国国会的“国会青年奖”是在1979年设立，项目由参、众两院共同推动，以表彰年轻人的主动性、服务和成就。它比美国总统奖含金量更高。但是它的申请要求比较复杂，周期比较长，鉴于此，我们邀请了Congressional Award Now（ CAN）Club 的创始人 Amy Gao和Aiden Liu两位同学以及他们的家长向CACC的家长及同学们介绍国会奖，及如何去申请国会奖并分享他们的经验。美国国会奖参与年龄为13.5岁以上，希望适龄家长和学生积极参加，同时也欢迎低年级的同学和家长前来了解 ，早做规划。 时间 ： 2025年8月24日 9：00 AM 地点：Amador Valley High school Q205 教室 Previously, CACC helped eligible volunteers apply for the President’s Volunteer Service Award (PVSA). However, as of May 2025, the PVSA has been suspended indefinitely. To continue recognizing students’ dedication to volunteerism and service to CACC and the community, we are now fully supporting applications for the Congressional Award—a more prestigious alternative. Established in 1979 and endorsed by both the U.S. Senate and House of Representative, the Congressional Award honors young individuals for their initiative, service, and achievement. It holds greater recognition but requires a more detailed application process and a longer commitment period. We invite founders of the Congressional Award Now (CAN) Club—Amy Gao & Aiden Liu—along with their parents to share the information about the Congressional Award and how to apply it. The Congressional Award is open to students aged 13.5+ 。Students aged 13+ and their parents are encouraged to attend the lecture. Younger students and parents are welcome to attend for future planning. Time : Aug 24 2025 9:00 AM Location: Amador Valley High school classroom Q205 CACC, PO Box 12028, Pleasanton, CA 94588
